Installation
To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. If not, download and install them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-app.git

2. Install dependencies
Navigate into the project directory and install the dependencies.
cd quiz-app
npm install

3. Run the app
Start the development server to view the app in your browser.
npm start
This will run the app on http://localhost:3000 by default.

4. API (Backend)
